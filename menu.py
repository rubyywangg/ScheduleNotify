def do_menu(title, choices):
    """Display a text menu of choices and return the user's choice (from
    keyboard input).

    All but the last choice are customizeable and are numbered 1, 2, and
    so on.  The last choice is always "X. Exit."  For example:

        ***********
        * My Menu *
        ***********
        Make a choice:

        1. Do something
        2. Do something else
        3. Do some other thing

        X. Exit

        Your choice: 

    Parameters:

        title: A str representing a title for the menu.  (In the example
        above, "My Menu" is the value of title.)

        choices: A list of strings representing the menu choices,
        excluding "Exit".  These are presented in order of occurrence in
        the list.  As menu item numbers are generated automatically,
        these should not appear in the list.  (In the example above, the
        list ["Do something", "Do something else",
        "Do some other thing"] is the value of choices.)

    Returned value:

        An integer representing the user's choice if the user selects a
        numbered choice, or None if the user selects "x" or "X" to exit.
